# Open Privacy Framework

The Open Privacy Framework is a non-commercial project whose intent is to make access to privacy materials, guides and quick-start templates easier for organizations embarking on privacy reforms.

The framework's roadmap includes:
- [ ] Templates for scoring an organization's privacy maturity against a number of publicly available models
- [ ] Datatype definition lists for Personal Information and Senstive Personal Information, with industry specific views / subsets
- [ ] Privacy Impact Assessment questionnaires
- [ ] Data Asset Register / Record of Processing Activity (RoPA) models
- [ ] Algorithmic Transparency templates
- [ ] Data Subject Rights request form templates
- [ ] ServiceNow CMDB, APM metadata for privacy
- [ ] Packages for ServiceNow, Salesforce and other enterprise CRM / ticketing platforms
